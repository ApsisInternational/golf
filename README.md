## Challenge 001
In this challenge you must write a program that prints the missing digit from each line in the file input.txt.

Rules:
- You may choose any programming language but we must be able to run your code. We're flexible and if we need to install a compiler we'll do it, just keep it reasonable.
- Your program must read the file input.txt
- Solutions with errors or warnings will not count
- Each character counts as one point, the solution with the least amount of characters wins the challenge.
- If two solutions are exactly the same then the first commit wins.
- Fork this repo and pull request to this branch to submit your solutions
- We will post the winner on Sunday 10th of October, which means Saturday 11th of October is the last day for submissions.

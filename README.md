## Challenge 002
In this challenge you must write a program that prints all the prime numbers lower than 200, in pairs.

### Rules:
- You may choose any programming language but we must be able to run your code. We're flexible and if we need to install a compiler we'll do it, just keep it reasonable.
- Your program will not receive any param.
- Solutions with errors or warnings will not count
- Each character counts as one point, the solution with the least amount of characters wins the challenge.
- If two solutions are exactly the same then the first commit wins.
- Fork this repo and pull request to this branch to submit your solutions
- We will post the winner on Friday 23d of October.

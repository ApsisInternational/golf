# Code Golf
Coding challenges for golfers. Every challenge is stored in its own branch. Please fork the branch that you want to solve and pull request when you're done.

## Rules
- Each byte used in the solution is 1 point.
- The less points the better.
- The season lasts for 18 rounds.
- Awards are
  - Gold: Best solution
  - Silver: Second best solution
  - Bronze: Third best solution
  - Honorable Mention: Program fails.
- An Honorable Mention awards the sum of the most points (outside honorable mentions) + 50 points.
- In the case of a tie in number of bytes, the first final commit wins. The second player will get 25 points more than the Bronze winner in that round.
- The ranking is measured by Awards first, and then by Bytes.
- There may or may not be prizes at the end of the season ;-)
- You may jump in at any time and solve previous challenges.
